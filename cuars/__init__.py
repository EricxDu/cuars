"""
CUARS is designed to take computer data and arrange it in a useful
manner for display to a user. It's also intended to launch and manage
processes for the user.

Intended applications are as follows.

1. display filenames in a filesystem for selection and navigation
2. show data from an individual file with decode and format options
3. subprocess an executable file with an option to terminate

To these ends, CUARS has (TODO) classes to process the following data.

1. a list of strings representing filenames or paths
2. a string-like sequence representing file data
3. ???

CUARS has (TODO) modules to construct displays using the following
frameworks.

+ Tkinter, for a cross-platform demonstration of the layout and
  functionality of CUARS
+ Pillow, for a raw image of each display to use on embedded devices
  with tiny screens
